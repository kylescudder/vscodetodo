# Things To Do

A lightweight to do extension for VSCode that connects to your GitHub account giving you all your notes from any VSCode instance, collapsable categories for better organisation, and target completion dates. 

Replace all of those sticky notes scattered around your desk with a simple virtual solution.

## Features

- Access your notes from any VSCode instance, just log into your GitHub account, and there they are!
- Collapsable categories, allowing you to sort your notes into logical groups and only see what is important to you in that moment.
- Easily add new categories on the fly for when a new project finds its way to you.
- Uncomplete notes for up to an hour, for when you get ahead of yourself, or misclick. 
- If you are on a deadline, you can set a target completion date.
