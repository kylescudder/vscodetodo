 Another to do list extension for VSCode

## Features

A short to do list that allows users to track what they have done for a given piece of work. You know what a to do list is. Come on.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

![a to do list](https://i.imgur.com/9bDCkFt.png\ "Pretty basic stuff")

Now with categories!
![categories](https://i.imgur.com/25fsRUi.png\ "Now with categories!")

To Do items grouped together by category

After 30 days of being completed, To Do items are removed to reduce clutter over long periods of time.

<!-- > Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->
